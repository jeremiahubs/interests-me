  <h1> Rocket League </h1>

    <h2> Like I said in the main page, I play Rocket League a lot. I have been playing for a while and have had lots of fun over the years. I have countless combined days in this game, both on ps4 and on a computer.

  <h3> Gameplay </h3>

    <h2> Rocket League is simple in concept, with a car hitting a soccer ball into a net. The game can expand into more variety though. These modes can be hockey, basketball, football, and much more enjoyable and creative gamemodes. This game requires lots of adapting to situations, so new game modes help with this skillset while still being a new experience to a new player. </h2>

  <h3> Updates </h3>

    <h2>
      Rocket League gets updates every 3 months or so that also give the game a new themed season. The latest season was released on March 6, featuring an underwater theme. This underwater theme gives new water themed car decals, antennas, wheels, and goal explosions. There is a competitive and a casual side to the game, and the competitive side has ranks from Bronze to Supersonic Legend that reset every season. The casual side is something you can relax in.
