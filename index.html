    <h2> Hello, this site is about the games I play. <a href="https://jeremiahubs.github.io/ucg-Jeremiah/" target="_blank"> Last site</a>, I went briefly over the games I play right now or, at least, used to. The games listed were games that, looking into them, have a lot of backstory that is actually interesting and makes the games what they are today. These two games have impacted me a bunch when I was a little kid, and they still do to this day. </h2>

    <h2> The first game out of the two games is Rocket League. To summarize, Rocket League was probably the first game I actually enjoyed. I started playing 2 years after it launched, in July 2015. Ever since 2017, I have been playing the game a lot, accumulating about 6,000 hours along 7 years. </h2>

    <h2>
      The second game is Geometry Dash. Geometry Dash was a game I started playing in 2018-2019, while the game was launched in August 2013. The game was a game I started out playing on my phone on the way to school.
